          VALUE 1: Most felt in [CURRENT YEAR]
            - Need to create a test case in order to make this since I dont have a years worth of data on hand
            - One cont that is filled span's (allMoments)
            - try using a for loop to create the allMoments amount of spans
            - Maybe need to use flex so that they fit the container and adjust their size accordingly?
            - Display most felt emotion per day
            - Need to leverage mood.dates[] to calculate day of year and create the year visual
            - const dayOfYear = date =>
              Math.floor((date - new Date(date.getFullYear(), 0, 0)) / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24);
          VALUE 2: Most felt in [CURRENT SEASON]
            - Need to create a test case in order to make this since I dont have a seasons worth of data on hand
            - One cont with three (month) div's
            - Inside each month show the proper amount of days as small squares (Hopper)
            - If a day was skipped figure out a default color to indicate no data
            - Otherwise make the color of the day whatever emotion was felt most
          ---->>>>>> VALUE 3: THIS WEEK
            - Need to create a test case in order to make this since I dont have a weeks worth of data on hand
            - Show gradient of all felt emotions?
              https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient
            - Make it possible to click on day for more details
            - Do a bar graph that shows each emotion and how many times it was felt.
          âœ… VALUE 4: TODAY
            - Populate either a table or grid with all of the emotions tracked in the day
